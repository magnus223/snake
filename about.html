			<h2>About</h2>
			<p> Sprites head.png and apple.png are made by me in GIMP, bg.png, backgroud I only modified.
Sounds are from freesound.org.
Code of the game is based on http://greeboro.linuxpl.eu/playground/wunsz2.html, 
which i were trying to make much better version,
but still for some parts i coudn't find way to write them other/better way
like for example functions checkng colissions and placing new apple on board.
Parts of code which i were using are easy to see commented in source files.
Source of rest files is in a <a href="readme.txt">readme</a>
